#### Clean UI
This mod replaces some of PAs default UI with a more clean one

The issue with button arrangement on the main menu has been fixed in dev branch and will be pushed in a couple days, currently making progress on new_game scene and hoping to add some settings for the mod in the settings menu.

Feel free to suggest any ideas in 'Issues' :)
